To activate it, press CTRL+ALT+V (or Command+Option+V on Mac OS X).  Switch between shortcut key and name search modes by pressing the TAB key\n- You can now insert a clipping directly from the shortcut key help window, if accessed from the shortcut key prompt\n- Save the source URL (web address) of a clipping. In the New Clipping dialog, click Options and select the checkbox option \"Save the address of the source web page\".  Available for Firefox only\n- Improvements to Clippings Manager to maximize the area in the window for editing your clippings. The details pane (with the shortcut key, label and source web page address of a clipping) is hidden by default; to display it, select Tools → Show/Hide → Details Pane\n- Placeholders with default values.  Example: $[placeholderName{defaultValue}].  When pasting a clipping with such a placeholder, the dialog prompt will supply a default value which you can accept or change\n- Placeholders with multiple selectable values.  Example: $[placeholderName{value1|value2|value3|...}].  When pasting a clipping with such a placeholder, the dialog prompt will display a drop-down menu where you can select from the available values\n- New Placeholder Toolbar in Clippings Manager, for novice users discovering the convenience of placeholders.  Turn it on by clicking Tools → Placeholder Bar in Clippings Manager\n- A fresh new look for the Clippings toolbar button in Firefox and Thunderbird, the Clippings context menu and Clippings Manager\n- Visual enhancements to the Clippings context menu on Linux.  Folder menus appear in bold, and clippings with color labels are colorized in the submenus, to compensate for the inability to show menu item icons on some Linux distributions\n- Many other improvements to keep Clippings up to date with current and next few releases of Firefox and Thunderbird\n\n\nSupported Languages:\n\nClippings 5.0 is available in English (United States), French, and Italian.  New in version 5.0 is support for Finnish and Slovenian.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of availability of translators, many of the languages that Clippings was previously available in are unavailable for 5.0.  If you are fluent in English and another world language and would like to help update the translations for Clippings, consider joining Babelzilla and signing up for your language team at http://beta.babelzilla.org/projects/p/clippings\n\n\nUsers of Firefox Developer Edition:\n\nClippings is not yet compatible with multi-process browser tabs (a.k.a. Electrolysis or e10s) in Firefox.  This will be addressed in an upcoming release.  In the meantime, turn off multi-process tabs to continue using Clippings.","shortcutKey":"","sourceURL":"","label":"green"},{"name":"Test signature (for issue #35)","content":"<b>Alex</b><br>\nAE Creations website<br>\n<a href=\"http://aecreations.sourceforge.net/\"><font style=\"color:#a349a4 !important\">http://aecreations.sourceforge.net</font></a><br>\n<br>\nthe AE Creations blog<br>\n<a href=\"http://aecreations.blogspot.com/\"><font style=\"color:#a349a4 !important\">http://aecreations.blogspot.com</font></a>","shortcutKey":"","sourceURL":"https://github.com/aecreations/clippings/issues/35","label":""}]},{"name":"Release announcement","content":"A new release of $[extension_name] is now available from Mozilla Add-ons and the AE Creations website.\n\nIf you already have an older version of $[extension_name] installed, it will be upgraded for you if automatic extension updates are enabled.
