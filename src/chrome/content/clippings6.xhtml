      <h1>Clippings 6 <small> &#8211; Now Available</small></h1>
      <p><strong>Clippings 6</strong> is a WebExtension that is compatible with
      Firefox 57 and newer.  If you are planning on upgrading Firefox to a
      newer version, you should also prepare for upgrading Clippings to
      version 6.</p>
    </div>

    <main>
    
    <h2>Get Ready</h2>

    <p>Once Clippings is upgraded to the new WebExtension, there is an extra
    step you will need to take to bring your clippings over.  To prepare for
    the upgrade, you should <strong>save a backup</strong> of your clippings.</p>

    <aside id="backup-hint">
      <p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can backup your clippings as many times
      as you want, until Clippings is upgraded to version&nbsp;6.</p>
      <p>You may want to do this to ensure you have the most
      up-to-date backup.</p>
    </aside>
    
    <article id="backup-instructions">

      <h3>Backup Your Clippings</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Open Clippings Manager.</li>
    
       <li>Click <span class="cmd">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="cmd">Backup</span>.</li>
    
       <li>Select a location on your system to export to (such as the Desktop
       or your Documents folder).</li>
      </ol>

    </article>

    <p>Make sure you <strong>remember</strong> where you saved the backup.  You
    will need to locate the backup clippings file once Clippings is upgraded.</p>

    <p class="cta"><b>&#10148;</b> <a href="#" onclick="openClippingsMgr()">Click here to open Clippings Manager</a> and save a backup now.</p>

    <h2>After Upgrading to Clippings 6</h2>

    <p>After the upgrade is complete, follow the on-screen instructions 
    to bring your clippings over to Clippings 6, and you'll be up
    and running again.</p>
