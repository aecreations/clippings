OUTSTANDING ISSUES FROM CLIPPINGS 1.0/1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [DEFERRED] Get rid of selection hack/kludge when adding the contents 
  of an HTML rich edit box as a new entry, via "New" command (bug 12408)
- [WONTFIX] Need to decide on status of "Undo Undo" - should it be 
  exposed as a UI in Clippings Manager, with full multi-level redo capability?
- [DEFERRED] Unsightly "jolt" when list item deleted (bug 11905)


TO-DO FOR CLIPPINGS 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [DONE] Import and export Clippings data (RDF/XML)
- Memory leak (bug 12999)


TO-DO FOR CLIPPINGS 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Folders
- Save source URL of Clippings entry if created from a Web page
   - new URL property for each RDF node
   - Check box in New Clipping dialog - "Remember Web location"
- Browser sidebar
- Be able to jump to the URL in which the Clippings entry was created 
  from - like Opera's Notes feature
   - Double-click on an entry from sidebar opens URL in current window
   - Right-click menu option to open in new tab
- Print Clippings
- More export options (as HTML or RDF/XML)
- End user help - may need to remove "leave me alone" Easter egg... =(


OTHER IDEAS
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Multi-select in Clippings Manager
- Button or shortcut key to delete all entries
- Be able to add images to Clippings
- Password protection
- Folders and subfolders (like browser bookmarks)
- Web-based Clippings: share Clippings with other Web users
- Embed placeholders into entry text; when inserting entry, prompt
  for text to substitute into placeholders

- Rich Text:
   - When inserting rich edit box entries, insert with tags or insert
     as plain text
   - And when pasting rich text entries, paste with tags or paste as
     plain text only
