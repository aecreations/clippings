TO DO AFTER CLIPPINGS 2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CLIPPINGS 2.5.1 - Firefox (and Thunderbird 2.0b1-b2):
Fixes for bug 16029:
- [DONE] Rename AppUtils object to something unique, e.g. aeClippingsUtils
- [DONE] Upon initialization, aeClippingsUtils, String.ae_fmt() and
  String.trim() should check if it is already defined to prevent variable
  redefinition problems

CLIPPINGS 2.6 - Thunderbird 2.0:
- Include fixes for bug 16029
- Quote or unquote text to be created or pasted (Thunderbird only)

CLIPPINGS 3.0:
- Shared Clippings data source between Firefox and Thunderbird
- Don't overwrite clipboard contents when pasting clippings
- Paste last-selected clipping.  Implement this after the "don't overwrite
  clipboard" feature.
- In Clippings Mgr - count number of characters in a clipping
- Clippings toolbar?
- Clippings "smart tag" (a la MS Office) that appears on a Web page textbox.
  Users can click on it to display the Clippings menu.
  (Firefox only)

- Other user-requested RFE's to be considered

nsIClippingsService refactoring: 
- When calling remove(), reorder RDF nodes.  However, this will cause old,
  undeleted RDF nodes to accumulate, making the data source file grow in size.
  See comment in nsIClippingsService.remove().
