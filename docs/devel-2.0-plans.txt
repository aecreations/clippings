TO-DO LIST FOR DEVELOPMENT RELEASE 1.99.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - UI adjustments:
   - Hostapp context submenu:
      - [FIXED] Newly-created folder doesn't appear unless a new window is
        opened or Firefox is restarted
      - [DEFERRED] Check that error handling and auto-recovery still works
        (Can't test until import is fixed)
      - [FIXED] Regression: New/New From Selection doesn't do anything
      - [DONE] subfolders should appear as submenus
      - [WONTDO] If subfolder is empty, there should be a placeholder submenu
        (There's a bug where the placeholder item remains if a new item is
	created in the subfolder)

 - Clippings Manager:
   - [DONE] Data source conversion (1.x -> 2.0) on first run (bug 13690)
   - [FIXED] Folder deletion - eliminate the junk entries that are left 
     behind in the datasource file, causing the file to grow larger and 
     larger.

     contents
   - [FIXED] Move To menu doesn't update itself when new folder created
   - [DONE] Disable "Text" field in Clippings Manager if current selection
     is a folder
   - [DONE] Copy To and Move To
   - [DONE] If folder is selected, New Clipping command should create new 
     clipping at same position as selection, shifting down everything below it,
     instead of making the new clipping a child item of the selected folder.
   - [DONE] Make sure that Paste New/New From Clipboard still works

Clippings Manager changes to be considered for 1.99.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - [FIXED] New folder created as a subfolder of the folder selected in the
   New CLipping dialog, regardless of which folder was selected in New Folder
   dialog.

 - [DONE] Prevent importing of data source file!
   This can cause an "Unresponsive script" error or Firefox might hang.

 - [FIXED] "Unresponsive script" error sometimes when closing Clippings Manager
   Deleted items reappear again when reopening.  Can happen when repeatedly
   deleting and undoing deleting of very large numbers (over 100) of items.
   This causes detached entries to be left behind after closing Clippings
   Manager.

 - [FIXED] Drag 'n drop broken.  Wrong items are being moved!

 - [WORKSFORME]  No limit to undo deletion!

 - [FIXED] "New" instead of "New From Selection" in selected rich edit box
   (bug 13778) - this has regressed since 1.2

 - [DONE] Redo the New Folder icon

 - [FIXED] Entries sometimes renamed after move or copy (bug 14086)

 - [DONE] New clipping or folder should be created at current selection
   position, or at the end of the root folder list if no selection.

 - [FIXED] No elipsis after "New From Clipboard" command in status bar icon - 
   another regression since 1.2

 - [DONE] Export as Clippings 1.x
 - [DONE] Export as HTML
 - [DONE] Export dialog box
 - [DONE] Data in exported HTML file should be encoded as UTF-8

 - [DONE] Change New Entry dialog title to "New Clipping"
 - [DONE] In New Entry dialog box, be able to choose which folder to file the
   new clipping in
 - [DONE] Create a new folder while in New Entry dialog box, and make the
   new folder the selected folder to create the new clipping in.

 - [DONE] Clippings Manager - splitter between tree list and edit boxes

 - [DEFERRED] Do regexp replacement to fix ampersand problem in HTML/XML
   entities - this needs to be tested with things like non-breaking spaces,
   other special characters and international characters
   NOTE: Related Mozilla RDF parser bug 231548 - fixed in Gecko trunk.
   ** Workaround available - encode special char's using hexadecimal.

 - [DONE] Folder and clipping icons (bug 13756)

 - [WONTFIX] Extra click needed on Move button to close the popup menu
   after mousing over Move To or Copy To submenus.  (This is "normal" - see,
   for example, the File toolbar button in Thunderbird)


Clippings 1.99.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - [DONE] integration with Thunderbird (no SeaMonkey at this time)

 - [DONE] Re-evaluate plans to support Firefox 1.0.x
   ** Tentative decision: No support for Firefox 1.0.x.

 - [PARTIALLY FIXED] Cannot export as HTML in Firefox 1.0.x
   - HTML export may not always be in Unicode due to limitations with Firefox
     1.0.x (nsIConverterOutputStream interface not available); fallback on
     ISO-8859-1 if UTF-8 encoding isn't possible.

 - [DEFERRED] Clippings menu doesn't appear again after creating a new 
   clipping using the New or New From Selection commands on that menu. 
   (Firefox 1.0.x)

 - [DEFERRED] Bug fix: New clipping or folder sometimes not being created at 
   position of selection. (Clippings Manager)
   - Clippings/folders now appended as before - too many problems with 
     <rdf:Seq> renumbering suppression in nsIClippingsService.remove()

 - [FIXED] Clippings count is off by one after deleting folder

 - [FIXED] Bug fix: Clippings browser context submenu not being rebuilt when
   Clippings data with folders is imported.  The imported folders are missing
   and only show up when a new window is opened.
   An import listener for the hostapp is needed, like what Clippings Manager
   has to listen to clipping or folder creation.


Clippings 2.0 RC 1 (1.99.7 ?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [FIXED] Bug fix - folders not appearing in Clippings menu after they are 
  created

- [FIXED] Clippings context submenu appears out of nowhere when creating
  new folder via New Clippings dialog (Thunderbird only; Firefox ok)
  (bug 14300)

- Code review and retest - automatic recovery from data corruption -
  appears to have stopped working

- [DEFERRED] nsIClippingsService.flushDataSrc() - refactor code - serialize 
  RDF/XML instead of using ds.Flush() or ds.FlushTo()... would this finally fix
  the data corruption problem that so many users are reporting? 
  ** Don't do this now - high risk of breaking Clippings!
