DEFERRED TO FUTURE RELEASES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- XPCOM interfaces - where wstring is used, use AUTF8String instead
- nsIClippingsService refactoring: combine the methods 
  flushDataSrc() and flushDataSrcEx()
- Rename all XPCOM interfaces - prefix them with "aeI"

- chrome://clippings/content/clippings.js:791 - `setInterval' called in
potentially dangerous manner
Warning: In order to prevent vulnerabilities, the setTimeout and setInterval
functions should be called only with function expressions as their first
argument.  Variables referencing function names are acceptable but deprecated
as they are not amenable to static source validation.


                                    * * *


- [DONE] Shortcut key map (accessible via CTRL+ALT+V, F1)
- [DONE] Shortcut key map from Clippings Manager

- [DONE] If the deprecated pref "clippings.datasource.common" exists,
  set the new pref "clippings.datasource.location" to be the user's 
  home directory, then remove the deprecated pref.

- [DONE] Customizable datasource file location - dialog UI
- [DONE] Auto-increment placeholder variables

- [DONE] Datasource backup and restore from Clippings Manager
- [DONE] Enable/disable CTRL+ALT+V shortcut key prefix

- [DONE] Spell checking of clipping text (in New Clipping dialog and 
  Clippings Mgr)

- [DONE] On Firefox, add the Clippings toolbar button to the Add-on Bar,
  if it is not there already

Back-end improvements:

- [DONE] Refactor drag 'n drop code to use new Drag Drop API

- [DONE] Modify constructor for aeClippingsUtils to make it a singleton object

- [DONE] Move constants out of aeClippingsUtils and into a new singleton 
  object, named `aeConstants'

- [DONE] Move gClippings overlay object to the `window.extensions.aecreations'
  namespace

- [DONE] Deprecate and remove methods of the aeClippingsUtils object where
  equivalents exist in the FUEL and STEEL libraries

- [DONE] nsIClippingsService::createClippingNameFromText(): Don't rely on a
  pref to get the max chars in the clipping name!  Use a constant instead.



Questions:

- If the datasource file location is changed, will that change take effect
  immediately in the browser window and Clippings Manager?

- What refactoring of the XPCOM component is needed to support customizable
  datasource file location?

- What impact will customizable datasource file location have on the
  common clippings feature?


Other enhancements to Clippings:

- Expose the pref.js setting for maximum number of backup files in the
  extension preferences dialog
  (tentative UI added to extension prefs dialog, but its XUL code is 
  commented out)

- [DONE] Change the error message when there is no data on the clipboard 
  available for clipping creation so that it appears as a panel (attached to
   the Clippings toolbar button) instead of a dialog box


Rejected:

- Clippings toolbar, implemented as a floating panel (available only on
  Firefox 4 or newer)

- Find-as-you-type clipping search and paste on any web page text field

- Exempt spell checking of specific clippings

- When exporting to any file format, provide option to strip out HTML tags



Clippings Editor 4.0:

- Release update with latest XULRunner runtime and contributed Babelzilla
  translations
