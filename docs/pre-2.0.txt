STATUS OF CLIPPINGS 1.0
***********************

- [DEFERRED] Get rid of selection hack/kludge when adding the contents 
  of an HTML rich edit box as a new entry, via "New" command (bug 12408)
- [DONE] Improve repositioning previously deleted entry back into original
  position when undoing its deletion.  Make this repositioning 
  happen instantly.  Currently, the previously deleted entry reappears 
  at the bottom of the Clippings Manager list, then gets moved back.
- [DONE] Tidy up entry name in Clippings Manager when pasting as new
  if the entry name contains newlines or garbage chars at start of string
  (add a new string function - String.trim() - like Java's String.trim())
- [WONTFIX] Need to decide on status of "Undo Undo" - should it be 
  exposed as a UI in Clippings Manager, with full multi-level redo capability?
- [DONE] Remove debugging crap
- [DONE] Toolbar icons in Clippings Manager that change colour when hovered
- [DONE] Localization


TO-DO FOR CLIPPINGS 1.1
***********************

- [DONE] Clippings Manager display not updated when it is open while adding
  new entries via Clippings submenu commands (New / New From Selection).
  This is most obvious during first-time use; the "No entries..." 
  message and the "0 item(s)" message on status bar appear remain when 
  new entries are added (bug 12547)
- [DONE] Uncaught exception after last entry deleted (bug 11723)
- [DEFERRED] Unsightly "jolt" when list item deleted (bug 11905)
